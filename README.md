Personal Portfolio site project

## Specifications
### What the assignment dictates:
I can access all the portfolio webpage's content just by scrolling.
I can click different buttons that will take me to the portfolio creator's different social media pages.
I can see thumbnail images of different projects the portfolio creator has built (if you haven't built any websites before, use https://picsum.photos/ as stylish placeholders.)
I navigate to different sections of the webpage by clicking buttons in the navigation.
A link to https://www.altcademy.com on your website, makes most sense to put it at the footer. The text can be something like "Part of Altcademy's Fullstack Program".


Listing the steps I took in the creation of my personal portfolio website, warts and all.

1: Created README.md, index.html and style.css barebones files

2: Uploaded a default template and related folders.
